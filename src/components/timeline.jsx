                        <p>
                          Throughout this period, I've dedicated myself to
                          enhancing and mastering my backend stack by developing
                          various types of applications using technologies such
                          as React, Tailwind CSS, NodeJS, MongoDB. Currently,
                          I'm actively engaged in developing a serverless
                          projects with AWS, Typescript, CDK V2, CloudFormation,
                          Cognito, Lambda and Amplify.

                        <p>
                          I employed a library called Blockly, specifically
                          designed for constructing visual programming editors.
                          My daily responsibilities revolved around developing
                          and rigorously testing a digital adaptation of PDF
                          forms.This solution was aimed at enabling end-users,
                          primarily physicians, to seamlessly input information
                          into these forms through an application.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          ACHIEVEMENTS:The enhanced platforms facilitated
                          seamless collaboration between patients and doctors,
                          streamlined development processes, ensured data
                          security, and provided scalability and reliability.
                          The projectâ€™s success serves as a testament to the
                          value of strong partnerships and the effective
                          implementation of technology-driven solutions.

                          Gained hands-on experience in implementing agile
                          methodologies within the dynamic landscape of a
                          substantial development team. Expertly navigated
                          through Scrum and Kanban frameworks, leveraging the
                          power of Jira for streamlined activity tracking.
                          Implemented internal checklists to catalyze the
                          efficiency of our development process, ensuring a
                          well-orchestrated workflow. Drove the creation and
                          meticulous organization of Confluence documentation,
                          fostering a knowledge-sharing culture. Additionally,
                          played a pivotal role in coordinating team activities,
                          contributing to the cultivation of a healthier and
                          more integrated work environment. The seamless
                          integration of these practices not only enhanced
                          project efficiency but also nurtured a collaborative
                          and synergistic team atmosphere.

                          Online Nutrition consultancy. My activities included
                          tracking the progress of subscribers to achieve a
                          healthier lifestyle; updating the users database,
                          gathering information that later was used to
                          calculate, designing and programming a nutritional
                          menu. Also, I was in charge of remotely attending
                          users concerns, doubts and comments. During my time in
                          'Mi Nutriologo', I developed interest in learning
                          programming and found a way to relate to this area
                          with the IT industry.
